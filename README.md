# OpenSign

OpenSign is a fully decentralized document signing and notary system.  

Files are stored on the Interplanetary FileSystem (IPFS) and the signatures are stored on the Ethereum Blockchain.

This project is available to use at https://opensignapp.com

A version is also hosted on IPFS at https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUu7kuy7dHCC5RDL3hscji81Fb6EmoBRzmwcrgJweRVjJ/
